What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git folder is created.
I need to do it to create a new repository for the current working directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area gives us a preview of what is going to be committed.
It gives us the value to preview the next commit contents.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can stage just the files belonging to each logical state and then commit with a message describing the logical state.
